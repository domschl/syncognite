# RNN and LSTM for text generation

## Requirements

Check the [main page](../../..) for build requirements.

## Build

After configuration of CMake, `rnnreader` can be built directly by:

Note: M1 users should use `ccmake` to configure `USE_SYSTEM_BLAS` to `ON`. This uses the M1 hardware accelerators for matrix multiplication and leads to 3x-6x speedup. With M1 processors, even with 16GB, the memory limit above which macOS will swap seems to be around 4-5GB (2021-07-19), if a model uses more memory, speed degradation due to swapping is caused by macOS.

```bash
make rnnreader
```

## Dataset

`rnnreader` can be trained with any UTF-8 encoded text file. A sample (about a 1/4 of William Shakespeares works) is
available at `datasets/tiny-shakespeare.txt`.

Additionally, longer training text can be downloaded:

### Shakespeare's complete works

To download the Complete Collected Works of William Shakespeare (5x the size of `tiny_shakespeare.txt`) from Project Gutenberg, use:

In directory `datasets`:

```bash
pip install -U ml-indie-tools
python download_shakespeare.py
```

The resulting file `shakespeare.txt`, containing the complete collected works, can be use instead of `tiny-shakespeare.txt`.

This uses [`ml-indie-tools`](https://github.com/domschl/ml-indie-tools) to download the Complete Works from Project Gutenberg.
The library can be used to download arbitrary book-collections from Project Gutenberg, see [Documentation](https://github.com/domschl/ml-indie-tools#gutenberg_dataset).

### Women-writers

To download a collecting of writing by Emilie BrontÃ«, Jane Austen, and Virginia Woolf from Project Gutenberg, use:

In directory `datasets`:

```bash
pip install -U ml-indie-tools
python download_women_writers.py
```

Note: have a look at the download script, it can be easily modified for other authors, subjects or collections.

The resulting file `women_writers.txt`, which contains all book texts (about 12MB) concatenated, can be use instead of `tiny-shakespeare.txt`.

## Training

From build directory:

```bash
rnnreader/rnnreader ../datasets/tiny-shakespeare.txt
```

or, if you have downloaded the full Works:

```bash
rnnreader/rnnreader ../datasets/shakespeare.txt
```

or,

```bash
rnnreader/rnnreader ../datasets/women_writers.txt
```

## Output

### LSTM network

Training of a 6-layer LSTM network with 2x384 hidden units. The generator uses different 'temperatures' during generation:
